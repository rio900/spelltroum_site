## About the Integration

It's important to note that this integration includes **not only the web**, but also:

- **Solana Smart Contract** (Anchor-based program)
- **Spelltroum Game Backend API**
- **Spelltroum Game Client** (Unity, iOS/Android)

All components are **fully synchronized** as part of the system we call:

> **Skill-Based Battle Pool** — a Solana-powered PvP mode that allows players to stake SOL and compete for rewards based on performance.

## Access to Other Repositories

The smart contract, backend, and game client are currently in **private repositories**.

> **Access can be granted to judges upon request.**
